# 2DGameEngine  
I implemented a basic game engine with c++ programming language during a game jam. 
My goal was to practice object oriented programming.
I used OOP principles and data structures in the STL library.  

# Requirements  
SFML library needs to be installed and you need to put dll files and codes to the same folder.  
Also you need to set some project settings in visual studio.  
(There are tutorials in youtube for this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axIgxBQVBg0)   

 It is not a playable game :) but here is a short video of the gameplay :
